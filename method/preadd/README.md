# PREADD Method Implementation

This repository contains the reproduction of PREADD method as proposed in the paper *PREADD: Prefix-Adaptive Decoding for Controlled Text Generation*, available [here](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.636/). This baseline method utilizes prefix-adaptive decoding to enable more effective and controlled text generation by dynamically adjusting the prefixes used during the generation process.
